# Turtlebot localization using the detection of floor tiles

In the scope of this project, the main objective is to develop an algorithm with the ability to perform trajectory generation based on a given set of waypoints, back it up with odometry equations of the model, afterwards perform a simulation over the generated trajectory in order to get the correct measures of the lines and finally perform an estimation with kalman filter algorithm and to study its performance. The project is based on a (2,0) robot model, in combination with infrared sensors to detect the lines between the floor tiles.

The main objective of the project is to have a working hybrid localization system implemented in ROS so it can be used in localization labs for real.
